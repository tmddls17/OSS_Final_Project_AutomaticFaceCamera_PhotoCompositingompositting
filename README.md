### 1) Background


![correct_posture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61749998/167976899-e1e67e4c-a6c3-4f5c-b18c-3c80eb9d35ab.png)

 Due to COVID-19, many people are having difficulty accessing outdoor activities such as gyms than in the past. Also, even if you go to the gym, you must receive PT (Personal Training) to do high-quality exercise with the correct posture, but PT is often not provided because the cost of PT is very expensive.
 If exercisers do not receive PT and exercise in an incorrect posture, they may lose health rather than gain health through exercise. Therefore, the APP was developed to provide exercise in an accurate posture to each individual without a large cost.

### 2) Target users

- People who have the burden to use money on learning sports.
- People who are adapted to mobile applications.
- People with no sports education centers nearby.

### 3) Goal

- Easy access to exercise
- Exercises can be learned at no cost.
- Receive accurate exercise posture and feedback in real time.

- i. User selects the sport to test their pose
- ii. User recognizes the compositions of the video, and the posture by watching the video of the experts
- iii. Turns on the camera
- iv. Set the composition of the camera (angle, distance), and do the selected sports.
- v. The PT App will check how much user's pose similar with guide pose and show the result to the user.


## Sourcecode


## Conclusion

### 1) Demo video

### 2) Limitation

- The PT App cannot catch multiple people, only one person can use it.
- It was impossible to measure and inspect a perfectly accurate posture by reading the coordinates of each joint with a camera during exercise.

### 3) Future studies

- I thought that the PT (Pocket trainer) APP would not only provide the exercise method and frequency, but also form an exercise community that exchanges information with each other and shares exercise experiences.
- Currently, the type of exercise is limited to one, but if we want to add a new exercise, we can continuously add it.
